## Business Requirements
The goal is to have an AI-powered chat agent that helps students translate an English sentence
into Portuguese. 

## Functional Requirements
The student must have a UI to be able to type in their English sentence. 
The chat agent must help return a translated sentence in Portuguese.

## Assumptions
We are assuming that we will be able to run Open-source LLMs at a free tier or close 
to free tier on the cloud.

## Constraints
The client wants this functionality to be done as cheaply as possible. 
The client does not want to invest in on-premise and will rather host in the cloud if possible.
If it's cheaper to run on-premise, the clients would the prefer to take that direction.
